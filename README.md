## 🏆 My Projects

1. **[AICONVERTER](https://github.com/salmanghouridev/aiconverter)** - A web application built with Next.js and Python, providing a user-friendly interface for the AIConverter library. This application allows users to upload files and convert them to various formats using the AIConverter Python library.

2. **[RedError](https://github.com/salmanghouridev/RedError)** - RedError is a proposed solution that aims to simplify error identification for developers. It offers a one-click search feature to locate coding errors. If the search doesn't find the error, users can post it on the RedError Author Account or connect with other users for assistance through comments. This solution enhances the efficiency, timeliness, and speed of the development process. Contributions are welcome to further improve this project.
