## 🏆 My Projects

1. **[AICONVERTER](https://github.com/salmanghouridev/aiconverter)** - A web application using Next.js and Python to provide a user-friendly interface for the AIConverter library. This application allows users to upload files and convert them to various formats using the AIConverter Python library.
2. **[RedError](https://github.com/salmanghouridev/RedError)** - The proposed solution for the project aims to provide a one-click search feature that enables users to identify all coding errors. In case the search fails to find the error, users can post it on the RedError Author Account or connect with other users who can help resolve the issue through comments. This solution strives to enhance the efficiency, timeliness, and speed of the development track. Contributions are welcome to further improve the proposed solution.
